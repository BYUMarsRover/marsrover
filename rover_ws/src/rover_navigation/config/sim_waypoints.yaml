# Waypoints for the SIMULATION environment
# NOTE: These parameters are parsed and loaded into the order planner in the action callback function.
# If you edit them, you'll need to kill the current action and request a new one using 'task_sim.sh'.
# You don't need to 'colcon build' the workspace after editing them like with other config files.
